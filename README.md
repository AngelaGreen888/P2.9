# P2.9

# User Study Presentation 2 on December 2, 2019:

Task Description: Move the player model left and right (using the left and right arrow keys respectively) to dodge incoming obstacles. Make it to the end of the game without hitting a single obstacle.  

Hypothesis: We believe that the users will be able to move the player model easily using the simple controls. They will collide with the premade obstacles and/or fall off of the stage and the game will restart after a few seconds of physics animation of how the blocks will move with each individual collision. We believe that it will be basic, and that the users should be able to complete the game within 5 - 10 minutes of playing. We also assume that due to the game being basic and incomplete, they will question the colors of the obstacles in the game to better differentiate ramps and obstacles. 

The game has basic functionality in the current time. We will add more descriptions and embellished screens in order to make sure that it's intuitive for the user to go through from the start of the game to the end. Also we intend on using machine learning to control the movement of the player model. It's very difficult to implement machine learning in Unity, so it will take a good amount of time to complete. We know the color issue of the obstacles and ramps to be confusing and will add this to the final product.

# Sketch Presentation 1 on November 22, 2019:
## About the game
This is an obstacle dodging game. 
The player will control a player model using machine learning with camera functionality to dodge incoming obstacles that progressively get faster the longer the game is played. The controls will be camera operated where the user will take pictures of what they will do to go left and pictures of what they will do to go rght for the machine learning aspect of the project. The goal is to go as far as possible without hitting an obstacle, or they will restart from the beginning. (This game is meant to be frustrating with the ultimate satifacation of finishing the game without hitting a single obstacle.) 

## About our team
![](P2.9.GroupPicture.jpg)

From right to left: Timothy Bell, Angela Green, Stanley Yoang, Abraham Esparza, and Jack Chen


Angela Green - Team Leader. Update the README file. Keep everyone on task, make sure we're hitting benchmarks. Help where needed. Keeping everyone updated and distributed the tasks. Making sure everyone has what they need to accomplish their tasks. Research UI for the start menu screen, the control setup screen, and the game's overall look while applying the design principles talked about in class. 

Timothy Bell - Research and utilize Unity to create the functionality of the game (moving an object left and right per user input). Research machine learning and implement it to apply to our game (taking pictures for the controls, storing them, understand how it works, etc.).

Stanley Yoang - Sketch the ideas that we all come up with. Make sure the UI/UX in the sketch will be similar to how it will be implemented. Implementing the menu design from the sketches and making sure that the product looks how we planned it during the beginning phase. Researching Unity and help create assets that are needed in the game.

Abraham Esparza - Research and utilize the machine learning that we learned from class under the project 1 resources. Implementing the capture of the user's camera, and be able to take a picture for the machine learning process.

Jack Chen - Research and utilize the machine learning that we learned from class under the project 1 resources. Implement the functionality of the machine learning process, in inputting a picture taken from Abraham to be utilized in the controls of moving the player model to the left or right.

## What we've done
Started researching everything we need, played around with Unity individually to get familiar with the interface. Tasks were distributed. Independently planned out what needs to be done to accomplish our designated tasks.

## Plan moving forward
Create the Unity game file, and create clones on everyone's computers. Focus on the distributed tasks, and get those accomplished. If we run into road blocks, we'll ask each other to knowledge share and overcome everything together.
